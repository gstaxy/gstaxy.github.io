### Lagrange

This website is build over the Lagrange Jekyll theme.

Lagrange is a minimalist Jekyll theme for running a personal blog or site for free through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), or on your own server. Everything that you will ever need to know about this Jekyll theme is included in the README below, which you can also find in [the demo site](https://lenpaul.github.io/Lagrange/).
